## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite  
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Custom components  
- **Styling**: CSS with custom styling system  
- **Routing**: Custom SPA routing implementation  
- **Build System**: Vite (outputs to `dist/` directory)  
- **Package Manager**: npm  

## Development
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)  
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (allows proxy access)  
- **Development Command**: `npm run dev`  
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`  

## Key Dependencies
- React 18.3.1 + React DOM  
- Vite 6.3.5 + React SWC plugin  
- Radix UI components  
- TypeScript support  
- Various utility libraries (clsx, lucide-react, etc.)  

## Deployment
- **Target**: Autoscale (for static website)  
- **Build**: `npm run build`  
- **Serve**: `serve -s dist -l 5000` (SPA fallback enabled)  
- **Production Command**: `npm start`  
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory (`index.html` for SPA + SEO HTML files at root level)  

## SEO Implementation  

- **Production Architecture**: Static hosting (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel) directly serves prerendered HTML for SEO routes and the SPA bundle for user navigation.  
- **Dual Content Delivery**:  
  - **Bots / Crawlers** → Served prerendered `.html` files from `dist/`.  
  - **Humans** → Load `index.html` (SPA entry), handled by custom router.  
- **Prerendered Files**: 29+ static HTML files generated in `dist/` during build with full metadata and Open Graph tags.  
- **Dynamic Routes**: Fully prerendered support for:  
  - `/articles/*`  
  - `/events/*`  
  - `/careers/*`  
  - `/business-automation/*`  
- **Fallback Handling**: SPA router gracefully handles non-SEO routes; bots always resolve to correct prerendered file.  
- **HEAD Support**: Prerendered files respond correctly to `HEAD` requests (static hosting default).  
- **Pretty URLs**: User-friendly paths (e.g., `/articles/iphone-17`) map directly to `dist/articles/iphone-17/index.html`.  
- **Sitemap**: `sitemap.xml` includes all prerendered routes with canonical URLs for indexing.  
- **Maintenance**: Run `npm run build:ssg` (using `vite-plugin-ssg`) to regenerate static SEO files in proper `dist/` structure.  
- **Production Ready**: Deployed on CDN/edge hosting, optimized for fast bot crawling and smooth SPA navigation for users.  

## Documentation Guides
- **SEO Management**: Complete guide for updating content, regenerating SEO files, and deployment  
- **Forms Configuration**: Comprehensive guide for modifying forms, validation, and backend integration  
- **Located at**: `src/guides/` directory with detailed instructions for future maintenance  

## Notes
- The project uses a custom router implementation instead of React Router  
- Multiple page components for different service offerings  
- Extensive use of Radix UI components for accessibility  
- Configured for production deployment on static hosting/CDN  
- Development server runs on Replit, production uses Cloudflare for global performance
