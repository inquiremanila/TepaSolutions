## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Custom components
- **Styling**: CSS with custom styling system
- **Routing**: Custom SPA routing implementation
- **Build System**: Vite (outputs to `build/` directory)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Development
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (allows proxy access)
- **Development Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`

## Key Dependencies
- React 18.3.1 + React DOM
- Vite 6.3.5 + React SWC plugin
- Radix UI components
- TypeScript support
- Various utility libraries (clsx, lucide-react, etc.)

## Deployment
- **Target**: Autoscale (for static website)
- **Build**: npm run build
- **Serve**: serve -s build -l 5000 (SPA fallback enabled)
- **Production Command**: npm start
- **Build Output**: `build/` directory (index.html for SEO, home.html for SPA, all SEO files at root level)

## SEO Implementation
- **Production Architecture**: Cloudflare Worker handles bot detection and content routing
- **Dual Content Delivery**: Bots receive prerendered HTML from build/, humans get SPA from home.html
- **Prerendered Files**: 29+ static HTML files in `build/` directory (root level) with full metadata
- **Dynamic Routes**: Full support for `/articles/*`, `/events/*`, `/careers/*`, `/business-automation/*`
- **Bot Routing**: Complete fallback system prevents 404s - tries direct mapping then generic .html patterns
- **HEAD Support**: Full crawler compatibility with mirrored GET logic for HEAD requests
- **Pretty URLs**: Maintains user-friendly URLs while serving correct content to bots vs humans
- **Sitemap**: Complete sitemap.xml with all routes and proper canonical URLs
- **Maintenance**: Run `npm run build` to regenerate all SEO files in correct build/ structure
- **Production Ready**: Cloudflare Worker deployment with comprehensive bot coverage

## Documentation Guides
- **SEO Management**: Complete guide for updating content, regenerating SEO files, and deployment
- **Forms Configuration**: Comprehensive guide for modifying forms, validation, and backend integration
- **Located at**: `src/guides/` directory with detailed instructions for future maintenance

## Notes

- Multiple page components for different service offerings
- Extensive use of Radix UI components for accessibility
- Configured for production deployment with Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare Worker (worker.js) handles bot detection and SEO content routing
- Development server runs on Replit, production uses Cloudflare for global performance
